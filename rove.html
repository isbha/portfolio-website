            <h2 class="detail_main_title">Summary</h2>
            <p class="detail_sub_title">
                Rove is an travel app that is based on AR(Augmented Reality). The product will fulfill our goals by targeting and incorporating the ethos of cultural relevance with the three most important domains associated with travel: Navigations, Purchases and Food Experience. The functioning of the product depends on translation features, augmented reality for easy-direct references and familiar annotations such as currency, distance and weight.

            <h2 class="detail_main_title">Problem Statement</h2>
            <p class="detail_sub_title">
                How can we encourage exploration and immersion by bridging language and cultural barriers during travel?
            </p>

            <h2 class="detail_main_title">Brainstorming</h2>
            <p class="detail_sub_title">
                Within the context of travel, we decided to narrow
                down our focus to exploration. While we seemed to
                have narrowed our focus down to exploration, we
                quickly realized that there is so much and so many
                ways to explore.
            </p>

            <div class="img_container">
                <img src="img/rove/Branstorming01.jpg" alt="">
            </div>

            <p class="detail_sub_title">
                Exploring can be so many things including going to
                museum or trying local foods, checking out shops or
                sightseeing monuments. Additionally, it can be done
                individually or with others, as well as spontaneously or
                in a more planned out manner.
                <br>
                <br>
                After brainstorming and thinking about existing
                products and services on the market from Tripadvisor,
                Google maps, and Yelp to blogs, travel books, and
                private guides, we realized that there was an
                opportunity to create a product that would focus on
                exploring in the moment.
                <br>
                <br>
                As we were thinking back to some of our own
                travel experiences as well as drawing from the
                survey data we collected, we realized that there
                was a common obstacle in the way of exploration.
            </p>

            <p class="detail_sub_title right orange">
                A language barrier, for many people, can lead to a lack of understandability in a new environment. This is especially
                difficult for people with little travel
                experience or people that are mono linguistic.
            </p>

            <p class="detail_sub_title right brown">
                When traveling, a lot of people seek to immerse themselves in a new cultures. A lack of understandability can prevent some people from cultural immersion and getting richer travel experiences. For some people, the inability to read signs and understand people can cause
                anxiety during travel. Luckily, with
                available technology, many of the
                annoying tasks such as converting
                currency to one that you are familiar with or trying to translate words from an
                unfamiliar language can be made a lot easier.

            <p class="detail_sub_title">
                We set out to help travelers transition from feeling
                anxiety over the unfamiliar to exploring the
                unfamiliar and opening themselves up to new
                experiences.

            <h2 class="detail_main_title">Brand Identity</h2>
            <p class="detail_sub_title mb-100">
                We set our brand identity that will communicate to users.<br>
                <br>

                - The brand should reflect the attributes of familiarity and comfort.<br>
                - The brand needs to be inclusive/universal while the design needs to be adaptive to accommodate various cultures<br>
                - It should have an identity that works for all age groups (within the age for traveling).<br>
            </p>

            <p class="detail_sub_title mb-100">

                -The different number of countries and languages we can include in our product for use by travelers. <br>
                -Speed and accuracy of the augmented reality feature and ease of real time translations. <br>
                -The number of users using the app and the diversity of those users <br>
                -The time spent on the application per individual user. <br>

            <h2 class="detail_main_title">User Research (Online Survey)</h2>
            <p class="detail_sub_title">
                To understand what the the user want, we first collected information from articles and books. We then made a survey <br> that questions users’ experience in traveling into three categories.
                <br>
                <br>

                1) Frequency of travel and language/conversion barriers <br>
                <span>
                    -How many times a year do you travel overseas? <br>
                -How often do you travel alone? (if often explain why) <br>
                -How often do you travel to countries where you experience a language barrier? <br>
                -Is it ever difficult to convert local currencies to your home currency in your head? <br>
                -What are the biggest obstacles in the way of cultural immersion for you when you travel? <br>
                </span>
                <br>
                2) Memory and Documentation <br>
                <span>
                    -How do you document your trips? <br>
                -Do you document in the moment or at a later time? <br>
                -When trying to recall a trip you went on, do you think back to location, time of travel specific activities you did, <br>
                and/or your companions? <br>
                -Do you share your travel experiences and suggestions with people? And if yes how? <br>
                </span>
                <br>
                3) Trip planning <br>
                <span>
                    -Do you tend to rigorously plan your trips, leave room for spontaneous exploration, or somewhere in between? <br>
                -What do you use to help you plan your trips (books, websities, apps…) ? <br>
                -What sources of travel information are the most reliable for you (instagram, friends, word of mouth, blogs, books, <br>
                TV or movies, travel companies…)? <br>
                -What products/services do you use during your travels (camera, phone, google maps, websites, apps...)? <br>
                -Do you ever feel like you don’t know what to do at any point during your travels? <br>
                </span>
            </p>

            <div class="img_container">
                <img src="img/rove/interview.png" alt="">
            </div>
            <p class="detail_sub_title mb-100">

                The insights we gathered from the survey results were the followings:<br><br>

                1)Travellers are generally eager to explore but can feel lost and anxious when physically presented with a cultural barrier to immersion. This barrier can include a difference in language, navigation tools, food and currency. <br><br>

                2)There is a gap in micro-exploration within an area. This application can aid a user know more about his or her immediate environment though user generated ratings, reviews, and hashtags from other users of the same county of origin; and see it live using augmented reality.<br><br>

                3)Monolinguistic travellers generally feel completely overwhelmed and are unable to perform basic travel necessities such as reading, navigation and speaking. An added disadvantage for people within this category can be old age and thus limited flexibility and adaptability.<br><br>

            <p class="detail_sub_title mb-100">
                We need to understand a user’s journey in different kinds of travel scenarios. Travel can be in many forms, such as business, leisure or for medical purposes. We want to understand how to make a user feel more comfortable while still promoting exploration. A broad theme of familiarity can be associated with all these scenarios and used with different purposes. We have thus divided our functions into three categories and are trying to explore deeply within them: Navigation, Shopping and Food Experience.

            <p class="detail_sub_title mb-100">
                During the 5 weeks of researching, designing, and prototyping, I learned when to collaborate with my teammates and when to divide the work. I also learned to narrow down the problems, and focus on only a few of them. At first we wanted to solve all the problems we found out by the interviews and research we have done. Yet, we soon realized that doing so will hurt the brand identity. We soon narrowed them by using graphs to prioritize the problems.
                <br>
                <br>
                If we had more time, we would have been able to conduct interviews with the people who are currently in the travel industry. That way, we would have had a deeper understanding towards the travel market. Also, I wish we could have done actual interviews instead of the online survey for a more detailed understanding of the problem.
            </p>

            <h2 class="detail_main_title">Next Steps</h2>
            <p class="detail_sub_title">
                -Develop and convert an emergency contact of the country the user is traveling. <br>
                -Scale the platform by interlocking the app with social media platforms. <br>
