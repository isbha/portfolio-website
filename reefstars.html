                “Envision a digital solution that will enable people around the world to donate to reef restoration efforts and have a direct impact on our ocean’s wellbeing.”
                <br>
                <br>

                The focus of this platform is:<br>
                1) Make the users excited to download or enter the interface.<br>
                2) Make the users constantly come back to the interface, and make donations.<br>
                3) make the users want to share the experience.

            <h2 class="detail_main_title">Summary</h2>
            <p class="detail_sub_title">
                This project was produced for a challenge initiated by the partnership between the Ocean Agency, Adobe, and Pantone.
                <br>
                <br>

                Reef Stars is a coral raising game I designed so that the users can emotionally connect to corals, be educated about global warming and how it affects the corals, and raise donations for the Ocean Agency.

            <h2 class="detail_main_title">Problem Statement</h2>
            <p class="detail_sub_title">
                How can I raise awareness of the falling ocean ecosystem and raise donation for the ocean among general people?
            </p>

            <h2 class="detail_main_title">Brainstorming</h2>
            <p class="detail_sub_title">
                My immediate response to this prompt was to
                design a game.
                <br>
                <br>
                First, I started listing functions
                of games that might fit for this cause. During this phase,
                I was thinking back to some of my own experiences in playing
                games. I then prioritized functions that seemed to be
                crucial and crossed out those which didn't seem to
                be very effective.
            </p>

            </div>

            <p class="detail_sub_title">
                After brainstorming the functions I could put in the game.
                I started researching about corals and made a list out of it.
            </p>

            <div class="img_container">
                <img src="img/reefstars/brainstorm2.png" alt="">
            </div>

            <p class="detail_sub_title">
                I then sketched brief concepts of how it would look like.

            <h2 class="detail_main_title"><br><br><br>Brand Identity</h2>
            <p class="detail_sub_title mb-100">

                - The brand should reflect the seriousness of currently dying coral reefs.<br>
                - The design and functions have to be emotionally attaching.<br>
                - The brand needs to be inclusive/universal while the design needs to be adaptive to accommodate various cultures.<br>
                - It should mainly aim for young adults who have economic independence and spend a lot of time in social media.<br>
            </p>


            <h2 class="detail_main_title">Success Metrics</h2>
            <p class="detail_sub_title mb-100">
                -The amount of donation collected. <br>
                -The number of users.<br>
                -The number of new users every day. <br>
                -The time spent on the app per individual user.<br>
                -The number of users using the app.<br>
                -The number of times posted or exposed in the social media. <br>

            </p>

            <h2 class="detail_main_title">User Segments</h2>
            <p class="detail_sub_title">
                -People who casually play mobile games. <br>
                -People who spends quite a lot of time in social media. <br>
                -People who are interested in the environment but don't know how to help. <br>

            <h2 class="detail_main_title">Contextual Inquiry</h2>
            <p class="detail_sub_title mb-100">
                We need to understand a user’s journey in different kinds of travel scenarios. Travel can be in many forms, such as business, leisure or for medical purposes. We want to understand how to make a user feel more comfortable while still promoting exploration. A broad theme of familiarity can be associated with all these scenarios and used with different purposes. We have thus divided our functions into three categories and are trying to explore deeply within them: Navigation, Shopping and Food Experience.

            <h2 class="detail_main_title">Macro Journey Map</h2>
            <p class="detail_sub_title mb-30">We first created a macro journey map to understand the areas within the travel experience where our app could make a difference. </p>

            <h2 class="detail_main_title">Micro Journey Map</h2>
            <p class="detail_sub_title mb-30">We then made a micro scale journey map to figure out what features within our app would be used at what time during the traveler’s experience over the course of one day.</p>

            <h2 class="detail_main_title">Style Guide</h2>
            <p class="detail_sub_title mb-30">

            In a desperate attempt to survive
            increasing ocean heat waves due
            to climate change, some corals glow
            in vibrant color. The corals produce
            brightly colored chemicals in their
            flesh that act as a sunscreen. These colors
            represent the vibrant colors of corals before death.

            <h2 class="detail_main_title">Reflection</h2>
            <p class="detail_sub_title mb-100">
                During the 6 weeks of researching, designing, and prototyping, I learned when to collaborate with my teammates and when to divide the work. I also learned to narrow down the problems, and focus on only a few of them. At first we wanted to solve all the problems we found out by the interviews and research we have done. Yet, we soon realized that doing so will hurt the brand identity. We soon narrowed them by using graphs to prioritize the problems.
                <br>
                <br>
                If we had more time, we would have been able to conduct interviews with the people who are currently in the travel industry. That way, we would have had a deeper understanding towards the travel market. Also, I wish we could have done actual interviews instead of the online survey for a more detailed understanding of the problem.
            </p>

            <h2 class="detail_main_title">Next Steps</h2>
            <p class="detail_sub_title">
                -Develop and convert an emergency contact of the country the user is traveling. <br>
                -Scale the platform by interlocking the app with social media platforms. <br>
            </p>
