            <p class="detail_sub_title">
                The project aims at making a user-friendly helping the users choose what food
                they want to cook or eat. It also aims at merging culture with cooking by
                making users explore new type of cuisines they have never tried cooking.  <br>
                <br>
                The goal of this platform is:<br>
                1) To help users choose what kind of food they want to cook.<br>
                2) Let users try cooking exotic cuisines.<br>

            </p>


            <h2 class="detail_main_title">Summary</h2>
            <p class="detail_sub_title">
                Cook Easy is a user oriented recipe application. When the user doesn’t know what he/she wants to cook, one can narrow down the options. Users can also search recipes by the ingredients they already have. Users can also add, rate, and share recipes.
                <br>
                <br>
                If the user types the ingredients in the search bar, it automatically filters the recipes. The users can filter the recipes by less ingredients possible, most rated recipes including the ingredients, or the accuracy of the search.  As in accuracy, it means that including most ingredients possible from what the user typed in the search bar.
                <br>
                <br>
                Along with that, there are step by step walkthroughs with words, and video tutorial walk-through so that even users with less experience in cooking can also enjoy cooking.
                <br>
                <br>
                Even for users with a lot of cooking experiences, they can benefit from “Cook Easy” in that the recipes are catetorized by style, and ingredients.
                <br>
                <br>
                Also, the user can make bookmarks of the recipes they want to keep. So if the user likes a certain recipe, or want to try it out next time he or she can find it easily from the bookmark tab. Users can also add, rate, and share recipes.

            <h2 class="detail_main_title">Problem Statement</h2>
            <p class="detail_sub_title">
                Is there a way to merge culture with cooking?

            <p class="detail_sub_title">
                I started brainstorming by creating a mind map with the keyword "cooking"

            <h2 class="detail_main_title">Market Research</h2>
            <p class="detail_sub_title">
                After brainstorming and researching existing
                products and services on the market from video tutorials
                like tasty, recipe applications like "Fork Over Knives" or
                "BBC Good Food", to even internet recipes, I soon realized
                that there was an opportunity to create a recipe product that
                would focus more on before the cooking experience.
            </p>

            <p class="detail_sub_title">
                Within the context of cooking, I decided to narrow
                down my focus to "knowing what to cook" before
                any action comes in. After narrowing my focus
                down to "pre-cooking", I soon realized that I also
                had a possibility in developing this application as
                a recipe app as well, with letting people try cooking
                exotic cuisines they have never tried cooking, or even
                eating.

            <p class="detail_sub_title">
                Do you have a food that is about to expire?
                Do you want to try cooking food you have never cooked before?
                Or do you want to try exotic food but are you scared to
                try them because it might have an ingredient you cannot eat
                for whatever reason?

                <br>
                <br>
                Cook Easy is the solution I brought up.

            <h2 class="detail_main_title">Reflection</h2>
            <p class="detail_sub_title mb-100">
                During the one week of researching, designing, and prototyping, I learned to make rapid decisions and development. Moreover, I learned that the design have to fully reflect what the brand is aiming for, from colors to even types.
                <br>
                <br>
                Due to time constraint, I could not focus on a lot of functions of the application. While I put much focus on finding recipes by the ingredients the user already has, I put less effort on the recipe itself. This way an important part of the application; the recipes has to be easily followable.             </p>

            <h2 class="detail_main_title">Next Steps</h2>
            <p class="detail_sub_title">
                -Further develop the recipes so that the guides are easier to follow for first time cooking users. <br>
                -Do more studies for the style guide so that it portrays the brand identity. <br>
                -Conduct interviews and user testing.<br>
            </p>
